This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project creates a static webpage for a my classmate page, with three student cards with test student names.
At the bottom of each card is two buttons, a like button in outline blue, and a love button in outline red.
Added vertically collapsing accordions to make visibility easier form multiple student entries.

Generative AI was used in my project. I gave the prompt of the base specifications to ChatGPT to get a baseline section for the static webpage.
After that, I began to make amends to the code to integrate the required and additional Bootstrap features, with some help from AI if I was unsure on
the proper implementation.

The accordions for the components I added completely by myself with no assistance from AI, as well as the array of test cases for the people
to ensure the functinoality of the card components, as well as the "love" button, which is a minor variant of the "like" button. 
The rest of the code has varying levels of AI assistance, with myClassmate being completely AI generated, and other lines being intially
AI generated with minor variations to suit my cosmetic likings from Bootstrap.
