This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project creates a static webpage for a my classmate page, with three student cards with test student names.
At the bottom of each card is two buttons, a like button in outline blue, and a love button in outline red.
Added vertically collapsing accordions to make visibility easier form multiple student entries.
